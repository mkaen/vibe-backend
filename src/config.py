# Here, you create a Settings class that reads variables from a .env file. This way, you keep secrets and 
# environment-specific settings (like your database URL or secret keys) outside your codebase, improving 
# security and flexibility.

# You can then import settings anywhere in your app without duplicating environment handling code. 
# If you deploy to staging or production, you only need to swap .env files or environment variables.

# You might also add a security.py file here for reusable helpers, like JWT token management or OAuth scopes, 
# keeping all security-related configuration in one place.
